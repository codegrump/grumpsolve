* Domains - intervals, ordered sets, etc
* Parameters - have default value, domains
    * Constants - single valued parameters

* Variables - for which are solved or constrained
    * Derived
    
* Constraints
* Functions
* namespace - can define constants, functions, sketches
* objects - are not subject to coordinate systems, useful as builders and configuration objects
* Sketches - can define constants, functions, inner sketches
    * Constructors
    * Fields - constructor fields and member fields
    
##Philosophy
* Parameters are variables
