# grumpsolve
3D Geometric Constraint Solving library written in java and based heavily on solvespace.

##The plan
* [x] symbolic algebra
* [x] simple newton solver
* [ ] substitution and simple optimizations for solver
* [ ] 2D geometric constraints represented as equations
* [ ] .grump scripting language for 2d sketches
* [ ] 3d geometric constraints represented as equations
* [ ] .grump scripting language for 3d models

##Why?
Because trying to run solvespace via emscripten in a browser made me grumpy.
