# grumpsolve
3D Geometric Constraint Solving library written in java and based heavily on solvespace.

##Why?
Because trying to run solvespace in a browser via emscripten made me grumpy.

##The plan
* [x] symbolic algebra
* [x] simple newton solver
* [x] 2d points, linear rings, line segments which can be constrained across coordinate systems 
* [ ] .grump scripting language for 2d sketches
* [ ] more 2d geometries which can be constrained across geometries
* [ ] substitution and simple optimizations for solver
